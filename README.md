Here’s the updated summary of **Embedding vs. Referencing** in your app, with **notifications** removed:

### Updated Summary of Embedding vs. Referencing in Your App

| **Collection**  | **Field**          | **Embedding or Referencing** | **Reason**                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**        | `tasks`            | Reference                    | A user can have many tasks, which will grow over time. Keep the document size manageable. |
| **User**        | `applications`     | Reference                    | Same reasoning as tasks. Applications can grow over time.                   |
| **Task**        | `userId`           | Reference                    | Users are shared across multiple tasks and need to be queried independently. |
| **Task**        | `providerId`       | Reference                    | Service providers are shared across many tasks and need to be queried independently. |
| **Task**        | `serviceId`        | Reference                    | Services are queried independently and can be reused across tasks.          |
| **Task**        | `address`          | Embed                        | The address is unique to the task and doesn’t need to be reused across documents. |
| **Task**        | `rating`           | Embed                        | Each task will have only one rating, so embedding it improves performance.   |
| **Service**     | `category`         | Reference                    | Categories are queried independently, making referencing a flexible choice.  |
| **Order**       | `userId`           | Reference                    | Users are reused across multiple orders and need to be queried independently. |
| **Order**       | `serviceId`        | Reference                    | Services are reused across multiple orders and should be referenced.        |
| **Order**       | `orderAddress`     | Reference                    | Geographic information can be stored in a separate collection and referenced. |
| **Order**       | `status`           | Embed                        | Status is tightly coupled to the order and does not need to be reused elsewhere. |
| **Rating**      | `serviceId`        | Reference                    | A rating belongs to a service, which is reused across multiple ratings.      |
| **Rating**      | `userId`           | Reference                    | A rating belongs to a user, which is reused across multiple ratings.         |
| **Service Provider** | `services`   | Reference                    | Service providers can have multiple services, so referencing ensures scalability. |
| **Banner**      | `imageUrl`         | Embed                        | The banner is typically a static resource, making embedding more efficient.  |

### Best Practice for MongoDB Schema Design (without Notifications)
- **Reference for shared or frequently queried data**: Users, services, and service providers are referenced for scalability.
- **Embed when data is tightly coupled**: Ratings and addresses are embedded in tasks or orders for quick retrieval.
- **Flexible categories**: Categories are referenced, providing flexibility for changes or reusability.

MongoDB (NoSQL Database) Concepts:
Reference:

In MongoDB, a reference is similar to a foreign key. Instead of joining two tables like you would in SQL, MongoDB uses references to establish relationships between documents in different collections.
Example: In a Tasks collection, there could be a userId field that stores the ObjectId of a user document from the Users collection.
